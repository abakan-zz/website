About Me
========

I am a Data Scientist at  `Kabbage, Inc <https://www.kabbage.com>`_ since
April 2014.

Prior to joining Kabbage, I was a Fellow at the
`Insight Data Science <http://www.insightdatascience.com/>`_ program and
worked as a researcher at the `University of Pittsburgh <http://pitt.edu>`_.

My research involved understanding biomolecular systems and discovery of small
molecules for modifying proteins involved in diseases.

You can find my published papers at `Google Scholar`_ and open-source software
packages that I developed for analysis, simulation, and visualization at
ProDy_ website.
